# Example Python Script

This directory (`src/`) contains your project's Python source code.


There is an example script called `hello.py` in this directory. Run it from the project root with:
```bash
python src/hello.py
```
or from within the `src/` directory with:
```bash
python hello.py
```
This script prints "Hello, World!" and tests importing key libraries to verify that your Python environment is set up correctly.
